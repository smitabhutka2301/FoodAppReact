**Food Recipe App**

**Overview**
This is a food recipe web application built with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the Spoonacular API (https://api.spoonacular.com/) to fetch and display food recipes. The app allows users to search for various food items like pizza, pasta, soup, and burgers. For each search, the app displays a list of relevant recipes along with ingredients and step-by-step cooking instructions.

**Features**
**Search Functionality:** Users can search for any dish, and the app will display a list of recipes related to the search term.

**Recipe Details:** Each recipe includes a list of ingredients and detailed instructions on how to prepare the dish.

**Responsive Design:** The app is styled using CSS components to ensure it works seamlessly on various devices.

**State Management:** The app uses useState to manage the state of the food recipes.

**Technologies Used**

**React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the web app.

**JavaScript:** For adding interactivity and fetching data from the API.

**Spoonacular API:** Third-party API for retrieving food recipes.

**Code Structure**

**Components: **The app is divided into reusable components to keep the code modular and maintainable.

**Containers: **Used multiple container and inner container components to optimize the code structure.

**State Management with useState:**

useState is a React hook that lets you add React state to function components. The useState hook returns a stateful value and a function to update it. For instance, const [FoodRecipe, setFoodRecipe] = useState({}) initializes FoodRecipe with an empty object and provides setFoodRecipe to update it.
